# How to think like a Programmer

# Ask the user for 2 numbers and add them

# Create an integer value for x
x = 0
# Create an integer value for y
y = 0
# Create an integer value for sum
sum = 0
# Ask the user "x =  " and put answer in x
x = input("x:  ")
# Ask the user "y =  " and put answer in y
y = input("y:  ")
# Put x + y in sum
sum = x + y
# Convert x to integer
x = int(x)
# Convert y to integer
y = int(y)
# Tell user "answer is " sum
print ("Sum is:  ")
print (sum)


#                         For loop
# Sentry: Integer variable that will control loop
#
# Start: Integer value of sentry at beginning
#
# Finish: Integer value of sentry at end
#
# Change: Integer to add to sentry at each pass
#
#
#                         For loop algorithm
# Begin with sentry at start and add change to #sentry on each pass until sentry is larger than or #equal to finish.
#
#
#                          While loop
# Sentry: variable that will control loop
#
# Initialization code: code that initializes sentry
#
# Condition: loop repeats if condition is true
#
# Change code: code to change sentry so condition can be triggered
#
#
#                        While loop algorithm
# Initialize sentry with initialization code then
# continue loop as long as condition is true.
# Inside loop change sentry with change code.
